# this is my readme file
# ou've just been hired by Alton's Hardware Store. Your job is to develop a tool which will allow his customers to calculate the cost for installing a fence. Start by determining the algorithm to calculate the cost of installing the fence.

Create a program that will calculate the cost with tax of fencing a rectangular yard. The cost of the fencing will depend on the amount of fencing required (the perimeter of the yard), and the type of fencing used. Gates can are available for an additional cost.At least one gate is required.
Prices (including installation)

    Wooden fencing costs $25 per foot
    Chain-link fencing costs $15 per foot
    Gates cost $150 each. You must install at least one gate and can install up to 3
    A building permit is required. It costs $50.00.
    The tax rate is 6.0% but it doesn't apply to the building permit

Your algorithm should allow any other person to achieve the same result by following your steps. They should not have to think about what they are doing.

Can you (or someone else) write a Java program that follows the same steps? If not, change your algorithm.
